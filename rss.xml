        When Big Data became a thing some years ago, I tried several frameworks, platforms and technologies.
        Most, if not all of them were not so good at hiding their inherent distributed nature,

        Machine learning doesnâ€™t have to be or seem complicated.
        It can get as straight-forward as counting and multiplying, which is the case with Naive Bayes.
